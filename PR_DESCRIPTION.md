# Visual Overhaul: Modern E-Commerce Design System

## Overview
Complete visual redesign of the Expo/React Native e-commerce app with a modern, polished design system. This PR focuses exclusively on UI/UX improvements without modifying business logic, API calls, or navigation structure.

## Design System Updates

### Theme Tokens (`src/design/tokens.ts`)
- **New Color Palette:**
  - Background: `#F7F6F3` (warm off-white)
  - Surface: `#FFFFFF` (pure white for cards)
  - Brand: `#C8A34A` (refined gold)
  - Text Primary: `#0E1013` (rich black)
  - Text Secondary: `#6B7280` (neutral gray)
  - Success: `#178A50` (vibrant green)
  - Danger: `#D33A2C` (refined red)

- **Border Radius:**
  - sm: 8px
  - md: 12px
  - lg: 16px
  - pill: 999px (for button styling)

- **Shadow System:**
  - `shadow.card`: Subtle 3px drop shadow for product cards
  - `shadow.sticky`: Heavier shadow for sticky bottom bars

## Component Updates

### 1. ProductCard (`src/components/ProductCard.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- ✅ 4:3 aspect ratio image with rounded corners
- ✅ Category chip (metal type) in top-left corner with brand color

- ✅ Card shadow for floating effect on background

**Visual Impact:**
Cards now have a premium, modern look with better visual hierarchy and clear CTAs.

### 2. Catalog Screen (`app/(tabs)/catalog.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- ✅ 2-column grid layout with 12px gutters
- ✅ Updated to use new ProductCard component
- ✅ Consistent spacing and padding
- ✅ Background color updated to new bg token
- ✅ Search bar with refined styling
- ✅ Category chips with brand color for active state

**Visual Impact:**

### 3. Cart Screen (`app/(tabs)/cart.tsx`)
**Changes:**

  - 72px thumbnail on left with rounded corners
  - Name + price stacked in center
  - Quantity stepper on right with background
- ✅ Sticky footer with `shadow.sticky`
- ✅ Checkout button styled with brand color and pill shape
- ✅ Improved empty state with brand-colored CTA
- ✅ Better visual hierarchy with spacing

**Visual Impact:**
Cart items are easier to scan, with clear pricing and quantity controls. The sticky footer creates a sense of permanence and urgency.

### 4. Product Detail Page (`app/product/[id].tsx`)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Large hero image with 16px rounded corners
- ✅ Swipeable image gallery with improved spacing
- ✅ Sticky bottom bar with:
  - "Add to Cart" button (secondary style)
  - "Buy Now" button (primary brand color)

  - Applied `shadow.sticky` for elevation
- ✅ Specifications displayed in clean grid
- ✅ Updated color scheme throughout

**Visual Impact:**
Product pages feel premium with large, beautiful product photography and clear action buttons that follow modern e-commerce patterns.

### 5. Button Component (`src/components/ui/Button.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- ✅ All buttons now use pill border radius
- ✅ Primary variant uses brand color background
- ✅ Secondary variant uses light background with border
- ✅ Text colors updated to use new design tokens
- ✅ Improved font weights for better hierarchy

**Visual Impact:**
Buttons are more modern and stand out better as CTAs.

### 6. Tab Navigation (`app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Active tab icons use darker color (textPrimary)
- ✅ Small gold dot indicator below active tab
- ✅ Updated tab bar background to surface color
- ✅ Improved font weight for active tabs
- ✅ Badge styling updated with new colors

**Visual Impact:**
Navigation is clearer with better active state indication and refined styling.

## Design Rationale

### Color Choices:
- **Warm Off-White Background (#F7F6F3)**: Creates a luxurious, premium feel appropriate for precious metals
- **Brand Gold (#C8A34A)**: Refined and elegant, perfect for jewelry/collectibles

### Shadow Strategy:
- **Subtle Card Shadows**: Creates depth without overwhelming the design
- **Stronger Sticky Shadows**: Signals importance and permanence

## Performance Considerations
- No new dependencies added
- No heavy animations or transitions
- Shadow optimizations with elevation prop for Android
- Efficient re-renders (no component structure changes)

## Accessibility
- ✅ Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards
- ✅ Touch targets remain 44px minimum
